# QuickWaystones (forked)
A plugin that adds Waystones for instant travel, making lodestones more useful!

## TODO list
- [ ] Teleport to players - player that wants to teleport to a target player must have a lodestone in their inventory (it gets used), and the target player must have placed lodestone near them.
- [ ] Special recipe for a waystone - uses 4 chiseled stone bricks, 1 target block, 1 enderpearl, 2 redstone dusts and 1 lodestone.
    - [ ] Embed persistant data into placed special lodestone block.
    - [ ] Breaking gives back the special lodestone.
- [ ] Try replacing inventory GUI with new dialogs system

## Changes over original (by SkyboundLab)
- **More Saving:** Instead of saving once on server shutdown, it will also save on adding and removing a waystone.
- **Bigger Menus:** Instead of a single chest, it now uses a double chest so you can see more per page.
- **UUIDs for IDs:** Allows mutliple waystones to have the same name and not override each other.
- **World Specific icons:** The 3 dimensions in Minecraft have their own block as the icon in the menu.

### Features:
- Right-click a lodestone to activate it as a waypoint
- Renamable waypoints
- Unlimited paginated Waystone GUI
- New crafting for lodestone, making it more accessible:
